    <h1>Proxy Rotator<h1>
</div>


After learning about **web-scraping** I found a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FbtCl9jJyyc&ab_channel=NeuralNine) that caught my attention. It comes from a really nice content creator called [NeuralNine](https://www.youtube.com/@NeuralNine) that works a lot with Python.

The idea of this system is really simple, when we normally scrape a site we can either have no problems at all or getting disconnected after requesting multiple times from a single proxy. Therefore, to solve this problem we will use a proxy list that will constantly rotate to let us scrape without getting blocked from the site.

### Sites :link:

- I used the same page as the video to get the proxy list: [here](https://free-proxy-list.net)

- As for the proxy status code trials I used this ip page but choosing a California IP: [here](https://ipinfo.io/8.8.4.4/json)
